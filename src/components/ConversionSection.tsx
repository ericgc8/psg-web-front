            Listen up, beauty boss! üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è In today's digital jungle, your online
            presence is your secret weapon. Without a killer website, you're

          <p className="font-bold text-neon-pink">
            Here's the tea: A good website isn't just nice to have ‚Äì it's
            essential for your business to thrive.
